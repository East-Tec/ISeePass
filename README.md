Passwords in web browsers are hidden behind asterisks. This is for your protection, but what if you need to see what you are typing, or trying to recover or copy a saved password from behind the asterisks? Use ISeePass. It's a tiny bookmarklet that instantly reveals all password on a web page. ISeePass works in web browsers across PCs, tablets and smartphones, running Android, iOS, Linux, Mac OS, Windows, and more.
